# Sorting-and-Graph-Algorithms
AnD HS20 sorting and graph algorithms as looked at in the lecture, implemented as generics in Java 11.
Following algorithms are included:
## Sorting
### O(n^2)
- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- QuickSort
### O(nlogn)
- MergeSort
- HeapSort
## Graph
- Breadth-First-Search
- Depth-First-Search
### MST
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm with UnionFind
- Boruvka's Algorithm with UnionFind
### Shortest Path
#### One-To-All
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
#### All-To-All
- n times Dijkstra
- Floyd-Warshall
- Johnson

Also includes graph datastructure and sorter interface with binarySearch.
All of the sorting algorithms are implemented using generic comparables.
